## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about backend systems, including distributed systems, system design, and high-performance architectures.

I thrive on deep technical exploration, continuously learning and breaking down complex systems to understand their scalability, reliability, and performance.

I’m particularly interested in systems design and architecture and I’m eager to apply my skills to high-impact backend engineering challenges, optimizing systems for scale and efficiency.
